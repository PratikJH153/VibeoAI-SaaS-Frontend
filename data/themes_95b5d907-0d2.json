    "text": "Thanks you all for joining us today. My name is Barbara. I am based in Chicago. It is still nice enough here to have the windows open, which is unusual for this late in October. We are waiting for one more person, but I do have a full hour of discussion and I did not want to delay all of you who were here on time. So if that person shows up in the next few minutes, we may have an additional person joining us. But until that point, we are just going to get rolling. So I thank you all for taking time out of your day today. As you know, we are going to be talking about headphones. I am interested both in the headphones that you own and in what headphones if any, you are thinking about purchasing. And then I am going to be talking to you about the worksheet that we sent you and the features and attributes that are on that sheet. And then I'll be showing you some imagery and a video that's sort of like an ad for a brand that you probably have heard of. And I am looking for your honest opinions about all of the things that I just mentioned. All of you are coming to the table with different budgets, different needs, different lifestyles, and I fully expect that the things that you each like and don't like won't be the same. And in fact, that's kind of the beauty of a focus group, is that we do get the variety of perspectives. I have been doing this long enough that sometimes I can see it happening where somebody says, I hate this or I love this, and the other person's kind of like, oh, well, I. I felt the other way. Don't feel bad if you have a different point of view. Don't feel bad if your opinion is different. Just know that that's how. That's the nature of asking for multiple opinions. So, looking for your honest opinion. I'm an independent researcher. I do not work for the company whose product we're going to be talking about today. My job is to find out what you think and what your thoughts are about the materials that I'm going to share with you. I said I have a full hour of things to cover for much of our discussion. I'm going to be sharing my screen and you're going to be looking at things. So we'll be looking at thumbnails of each other to the degree Possible. It's kind of hard to have a discussion, if you will, since we're not all sitting at the same table and you don't have that eye contact or body language. But if somebody says something and you're kind of tracking along and agreeing with that and I see your head nodding, then I kind of know right away there's some agreement. Or if someone says something and you have a thought that you'd like to jump in and elaborate on, feel free to do that. It's just a little harder to do it in this forum.",

We do have a few observers who are going to be joining us today. They are colleagues of mine working on the project. They take some notes, sometimes they text me follow up questions. So if I'm looking down at my phone, it's because I'm looking to see if there's a follow up. And then we also. Ryan turned on the recording before we started our discussion. So I just wanted to let you know that we're being recorded. Hi, welcome. You must be Chris. Thanks for joining us. You're just in time. So I was just, just getting us started and we haven't even done introduction. So I'd like to have each of you introduce yourselves. If you could tell us all your first name, tell us what you do for a living. Are you working? Are you studying? Are you an at home parent? And then I'm going to ask you a few questions about your headphones. So I'm going to just go in the order that you are on my screen. So Vivian, would you like to get us started?",
